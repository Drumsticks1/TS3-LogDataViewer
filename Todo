documentation:
    - update readme
    - check the relative location of configuration paths and add it to the documentation
    - add note about upload deletion problem between version 3.0.12.0 - 3.0.x

styling:
    - clean up style.scss

client-side js:
    - Check filter type (e.g regex) compatibility for the Nicknames, Connections, IPs and Server Group column.
    - Outsource the creation of the control sections for the tables.
    - Check sorting possibilities for the server group data in the client table.
    - add Channel table (the data should already be part of the json)
    - maybe: optional time timeBetweenBuildsWithoutBuffer for "Build JSON without buffer" (as it results in a higher cpu load)
    - maybe: make order of the tables configurable

Ban.js:
    - Parse Ban expiration and deletion and add it to the class.
    - Currently only includes the bans that kicked the banned client (= the banned client had to be online when he got banned).
        - Add custom bans (if they cannot be reconstructed completely: add a simple list with the log lines)

maybe:
    - Add channel groups.
    - (optional) log directory watcher for automatic parsing on log updates - only building of json required when calling buildJSON.
    - Add a ServerGroup table (maybe with rights and so on - would be long-term).
    - notification if a new ban, kick, complaint or upload was added since the last visit / new data marked in a different colour
	- Add ServerGroupName history like for the nicknames in the client list.
	- check options regarding multiple virtual servers (low priority)
