general:
    - add optional systemd and init.d scripts.

parseLogs.js:
    - Outsource the parsing in parseLogs to extra functions.

TS3-LogDataViewer.js:
    - Investigate the nanobar memory leak.
    - Split into multiple js files and use something like grunt for deployment?
    - Make pager optional.
    - Outsource the creation of the control sections for the tables.
	- Check sorting possibilities for the server group data in the client table.

Ban.js:
    - Parse Ban expiration and deletion and add it to the class.
    - Currently only includes the bans that kicked the banned client (= the banned client had to be online when he got banned).
        - Add custom bans.

maybe:
    - Add a ServerGroup table (maybe with rights and so on - would be long-term).
    - Notification if a new ban, kick, complaint or upload was added since the last visit.
	- Add ServerGroupName history like for the nicknames in the client list.
	- Add query clients to client list or a query client list?
	- Make it possible to switch between the virtual servers via Webinterface.
		- check what virtual servers are / were running by observing the logs filename endings.

When preparing a new release:
    - Update Install Instructions
    - Update Readme
