Add note about upload deletion problem between version 3.0.12.0 - 3.0.x

TS3-LogDataViewer.js:
    - Maybe: optional time timeBetweenBuildsWithoutBuffer for "Build JSON without buffer".
    - Split into multiple js files and use dev tools for putting them together?
    - Outsource the creation of the control sections for the tables.
	- Check sorting possibilities for the server group data in the client table.

Ban.js:
    - Parse Ban expiration and deletion and add it to the class.
    - Currently only includes the bans that kicked the banned client (= the banned client had to be online when he got banned).
        - Add custom bans.

maybe:
    - Add optional debug logging.
    - (optional) log directory watcher for automatic parsing on log updates - only building of json required when calling buildJSON.
    - Add a ServerGroup table (maybe with rights and so on - would be long-term).
    - Notification if a new ban, kick, complaint or upload was added since the last visit.
	- Add ServerGroupName history like for the nicknames in the client list.
	- Add query clients to client list or a query client list?
	- Make it possible to switch between the virtual servers via Webinterface.
		- check what virtual servers are / were running by observing the logs filename endings.
