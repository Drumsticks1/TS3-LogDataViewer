- Add possibility to set logDirectory and virtualServer.
- Comment functions.

parseLogs.js:
    - Outsource the parsing in parseLogs to extra functions.
    - Shorten parsing by using the substring() function instead of substr().

TS3-LogDataViewer.js:
	- Replace the description divs with buttons for sorting after the connected and deleted state and remove the "connected" column afterwards.
		- also include a resetSort option.
	- Add button for switching between bantime in seconds and bantime in x.
	- Make the server group data in the client table sortable.

outputHandler.js:
    - Catch errors like "no such file or directory".

General:
    - Limit rebuilds server side.
    - Add a ServerGroup table (maybe with rights and so on - would be long-term).

Bans: Currently only includes the bans that kicked the banned client (= the banned client had to be online when he got banned).
	- Add custom bans.

maybe:
    - Add test cases.
    - Replace XML creation and parsing with JSON creation and parsing.
	- Add ServerGroupName history like for the nicknames in the client list.
	- Add additional optional ignore files for the tables.
	- Add query clients to client list or a query client list?
	- Make it possible to switch between the virtual servers via Webinterface.
		- check what virtual servers are / were running by observing the logs filename endings.

When preparing a new release:
    - Update Install Instructions
    - Update Readme
