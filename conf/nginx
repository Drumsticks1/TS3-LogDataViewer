IMPORTANT:
This only covers the part of the nginx configuration that deals with the ts3-ldv integration.
If you aren't familiar with nginx: Take your time and create a secure configuration before adding
the following code to your nginx domain configuration located in the sites-enabled folder.

Another important thing is that you secure the access to the ts3-ldv webpage as it contains sensitive information and
should be considered a security risk when accessible by untrustworthy users!
If you aren't familiar with this you should probably have a look at this part of the nginx docs:
    http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html

Template for insertion into the server block of the configuration:

# Allow access to specific locations only - check nginx documentation for more information.
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;

    # Modify the location according to your installation.
    location /ts3-ldv {
        auth_basic "Authentication required!";
        auth_basic_user_file /path/to/your/auth/file/.htpasswd;

        location /ts3-ldv/express/buildJSON {
            # Modify the port according to your port settings in conf.json.
            proxy_pass    http://127.0.0.1:3000/buildJSON;
        }
    }
}
