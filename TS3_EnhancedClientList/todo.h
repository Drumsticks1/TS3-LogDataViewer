/*
general:
	- optimize the code for better performance.
	- add additional optional ignore files for the tables.
	- make it possible to switch between the virtual servers via Webinterface.
		- check what virtual servers are / were running by observing the logs filename endings.
	- limit rebuilds on serverside, maybe add cron.
	- add query clients to client list or a query client list?
	- add button for switching between bantime in seconds and bantime in x.
	- rename the project (as it isn't only a client list anymore).

Bans: Currently only includes the bans that kicked the banned client (= the banned client had to be online when he got banned).
	- Add custom bans.
