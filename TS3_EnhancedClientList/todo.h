/* Todo:

general:
	- find and sort out old IDs for the same person or merge them, or:
	- Maybe later: Compare actual database with the IDs and gray out / delete the deleted IDs.
	- maybe sort the UserList by ID
	- Connected / Disconnected Flag --> Online status possible
		- Add compatibility to multiple connects before disconnecting (e.g. User and User1 with the same ID).
	- Relative and absolute directory linking. (relative for development and absolute for final version).
	- Add missing descriptions (found by searching for the [Description pending] tag).
