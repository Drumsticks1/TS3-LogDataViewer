/*
general:
	- optimize the code for better performance.
	- add additional optional ignore files for the tables.
	- make it possible to switch between the virtual servers via Webinterface.
		- check what virtual servers are / were running by observing the logs filename endings.
	- limit rebuilds on serverside, maybe add cron.
	- add query clients to client list or a query client list?
	- add button for switching between small and big display tables on big displays.
	- add sort order to local storage.
	- replace blank tables with messages that no data was found.
