/*
general:
	- optimize the code for better performance.
	- add additional optional ignore files for the tables.
	- make it possible to switch between the virtual servers via Webinterface.
		- check what virtual servers are / were running by observing the logs filename endings.
	- limit rebuilds on serverside, maybe add cron.
	- add query clients to client list or a query client list?
	- use local storage for saving options.
	- change navbar for small displays (expandable navbar at the bottom for small screens).
	- update readme about foundation and responsive design.
	- fix table widths bigger than the window width (maybe scrolling in wraps, maybe switching to view for smaller displays).

Bans: Currently only includes the bans that kicked the banned user (= the banned user had to be online when he got banned).
	- Add custom bans.

Example: Add gh-pages branch with an example.
