/*
general:
	- optimize the code for better performance.
	- add additional optional ignore files for the tables.
	- make it possible to switch between the virtual servers via Webinterface.
		- check what virtual servers are / were running by observing the logs filename endings.
	- limit rebuilds on serverside, maybe add cron.
	- standalone (using electron).
	- make it possible to switch between IDs and UIDs in the ban table (maybe add a button bar on the right side for this and the buttons for the client list).

Bans: Currently only includes the bans that kicked the banned user (= the banned user had to be online when he got banned).
	- Add custom bans.

Example: Add gh-pages branch with an example.
