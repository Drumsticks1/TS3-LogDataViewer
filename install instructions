This installation instructions are intended for any linux distribution (you need to write your own init script for the ts3-ldv service if your linux distribution doesn't use systemd).
Experienced users may also install it on other operating systems but I may not be able to help with issues regarding anything else than linux.

- Create a directory for the LogDataViewer in a directory which can be accessed on your server via nginx (e.g.""/var/www/www.your-domain.com/teamspeak").
    - Set the directory owner and the directory group to your webserver group (e.g. www-data) to ensure that nginx has access to it.
- Head over to the directory you just created and execute "npm install ts3-ldv" (nodejs has to be installed).
    - This will create the directory node_modules in the current folder, ts3-ldv and it's dependencies are packages in this directory.
- Make the ts3-ldv user the owner of the ts3-ldv directory that npm installed (command: "chown ts3-ldv node_modules/ts3-ldv").
- Rename the default-conf.json in the /node_modules/ts3-ldv/conf folder to conf.json and modify it according to your web server and your preferences (information about the possible settings can be found in the configuration section in README.md).
    - If you don't change the programLog setting you will have to create a directory /var/log/ts3-ldv/ and set the directory owner to the user that will run the server-side app.
- Follow the steps in the nginx section below before proceeding to the next step.
- (optional, recommended) Copy the ts3-ldv.service file to your systemd service folder and modify the settings according to your installation.
    - If the distribution doesn't use systemd you will have to write your own init script for the ts3-ldv service.
- (optional, recommended) Copy the ts3-ldv.logrotate file for your logrotate.d config folder and rename the file to ts3-ldv (you need to change the log path if you changed the programLog setting in conf.json).
- You should now be able to start the server-side app via "service ts3-ldv start", access the location on your domain via your browser and access the interface.

If the program fails to start, doesn't work properly or you run into any other issues:
Check the program log first and ensure that you configured the paths right.


nginx configuration:

This section only covers the part of the nginx configuration for ts3-ldv integration.
If you aren't familiar with nginx: Take your time and create a secure configuration before adding
the following code to your nginx domain configuration located in the sites-enabled folder.

Security:
Another important thing is that you secure the access to the ts3-ldv page as it contains sensitive information and
should be considered a security risk when accessible by untrustworthy users!
If you aren't familiar with this you should probably have a look at this part of the nginx docs:
    http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html

(I also recommend something like fail2ban to prevent brute-forcing the auth, but this is only another layer of security, be sure you have at least the one described above!)

The following lines are a template for the configuration that allows access to specific locations on the server only.
If you don't use "teamspeak" as directory you will have to replace ALL occurrences of "teamspeak" in the below configuration according to your installation.
If you modified the port setting in conf.json you have to modify the port in the proxy_pass directives.

# Allow access to specific locations only - check nginx documentation for more information.
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;

    # Modify the location according to your installation.
    location /teamspeak {
        auth_basic "Authentication required!";
        auth_basic_user_file /path/to/your/auth/file/.htpasswd;

        # Ignore the node_modules directory for the rewrite after this location section.
        location /teamspeak/node_modules {
            # For use via your-domain.com/teamspeak/node_modules/ts3-ldv/
            location /teamspeak/node_modules/ts3-ldv/node_modules {
                rewrite ^/teamspeak/node_modules/ts3-ldv/(.*)$ /teamspeak/$1 last;
            }
        }

        # Rewrites the urls in order to make the ts3-ldv page accessible via your-domain.com/teamspeak/
        # and not only via your-domain.com/teamspeak/node_modules/ts3-ldv/
        rewrite ^/teamspeak/(.*)$ /teamspeak/node_modules/ts3-ldv/$1 last;

        # For the buildJSON request when issued via your-domain.com/teamspeak/
        location /teamspeak/express/buildJSON {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/buildJSON;
        }

        # For the buildJSON request when issued via your-domain.com/teamspeak/node_modules/ts3-ldv/
        location /teamspeak/node_modules/ts3-ldv/express/buildJSON {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/buildJSON;
        }
    }
}


Feel free to open an issue on GitHub for improvement suggestions for the install instructions!
