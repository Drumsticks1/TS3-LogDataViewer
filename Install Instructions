This file contains the install instructions for the TS3_EnhancedClientList.

Linux:

1. Create the directory "EnhancedClientList" in the directory "/var/www".
2. Set up a .htaccess in order to secure the access to the directory (Skipping this step may result in serious security vulnerability of your webserver!).
3. Download a compiled file (-> skip to step 4) or compile the code using the makefile (for experienced users -> follow the 3.x steps).
	3.1. Downloads the makefile and the .cpp and .h files listed in the subdirectory "TS3_EnhancedClientList" (the todo.h isn't needed for compiling as it doesn't include any code).
	3.2. Download the Boost Library package via "http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.58.0/boost_1_58_0.tar.bz2/download" and extract it to your "/usr/" folder (--> /usr/boost_1_58_0).
	3.3. You will need to install the packages "make", "g++", "boost-system-dev" and "boost-filesystem-dev" in order to compile with the makefile.
4. Download the jquery plugin "tablesorter" via this link: "http://tablesorter.com/__jquery.tablesorter.zip".
5. Move the "Webinterface.html" and the "jquery.tablesorter.js" (which is part of the "__jquery.tablesorter.zip") into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory.
6. Choose one of the tablesorter themes (can be found in the "__jquery.tablesorter.zip" under "/themes/green" or "/themes/blue" - choose one of the .zips and extract it in the EnhancedClientList directory you created on your server).
7. If necessary correct the theme path according to the chosen tablesorter theme in the "Webinterface.html". (e.g. '<link rel="stylesheet" href="./blue/style.css">' --> change "blue" to "green" if you chose the green theme).
6. Move the downloaded or self-compiled "TS3_EnhancedClientList" into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory and make it executable ("chmod +x TS3_EnhancedClientList").
7. Move the "rebuildXML.php" and the "deleteXML.php" into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory and change the file owner to www-data (= owner of the web directories) ("chown www-data:www-data rebuildXML.php").
8. Make the logdirectory readable and executable for group users ("chown g+rx /path/to/the/teamspeak3/log/directory").
9. Add the user www-data to the group under which your teampeak3 server is running ("usermod -a -G yourteamspeak3group www-data").
10. Adjust the LOGPATH in the "rebuildXML.php" if necessary.
11. Optionally add a file named "logignore" in your logdirectory and add the names of logfiles which you want to exclude from the parsing (Important: Create the file on linux and don't copy it over from Windows!).
12. Open the Webinterface on your webserver ("your-server/EnhancedClientList/Webinterface.html")
13. (Optional) If you don't like parts of the tablesorter theme you can easily adjust the settings in the "style.css" according to your wishes (e.g. font family, font size, border type, background color ...).
