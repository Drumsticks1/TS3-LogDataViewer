	5.6. Install the packages "make" and "g++" in order to compile using the makefile.
	5.7. Check the include paths in the makefile and adjust them if necessary.
	5.8. Compile with the makefile ("make -f makefile").

	- https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.tablesorter/2.22.5/js/jquery.tablesorter.widgets.min.js
10. Move the "TS3_EnhancedClientList.js" and the other javascript files you just downloaded into your EnhancedClientList directory.
11. If you want to use the provided index.html (headline and all tables) skip to step 12, otherwise if you want to include the controls and the table into an existing HTML follow the 11.x steps.
	11.1. Include the control section by creating a div with the id "ts3-control".

12. Move the "index.html" into your created EnhancedClientList directory.
13. Move the "styles" folder into your EnhancedClientList directory.
14. Move the downloaded or self-compiled "TS3_EnhancedClientList" into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory and make it executable ("chmod +x TS3_EnhancedClientList").
15. Move the "rebuildXML.php" and the "deleteXML.php" into the EnhancedClientList directory and change the file group to www-data (= owner of the web directories) ("chgrp www-data rebuildXML.php" and "chgrp www-data deleteXML.php").
16. Make the logdirectory readable and executable for group users ("chown g+rx /path/to/the/teamspeak3/log/directory").
17. Add the user www-data to the group under which your teampeak3 server is running ("usermod -aG yourteamspeak3group www-data").
18. (If necessary) Adjust the ECLPATH (path to the compiled file) in the "rebuildXML.php" and the "deleteXML.php" as well as the LOGPATH and the VIRTUALSERVER in the "rebuildXML.php".
19. Open the web interface by accessing the directory containing the index.html in your browser or open your self-created HTML on your server and enjoy scrolling through the tables.
20. (Optional) Add a file named "logignore" in your log directory and add the names of log files which you want to exclude from the parsing.
21. (Optional) If you would like to change the appearance of the web interface / your website you can do this by editing the "style.css" according to your wishes.
