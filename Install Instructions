1. Create a directory for the EnhancedClientList in your web directory (e.g. "/var/www/html/EnhancedClientList").
	! Skipping the next step may result in serious security vulnerability of your server as anybody would be able to access this directory !
2. Set up a .htaccess in this directory in order to restrict the access to the directory to you and chosen users or use a similar restriction method if you aren't using apache.
3. Download the source code of the newest release available (https://github.com/Drumsticks1/TS3_EnhancedClientList/releases).
4. Download the attached compiled file (TS3_EnhancedClientList.gz for Linux) from the release you are using (-> skip to step 5) or compile the code yourself using the provided makefile (-> follow the 4.x steps).
	4.1. Downloads the makefile, the .cpp and .h files listed in the subdirectory "TS3_EnhancedClientList" (the todo.h isn't necessary for compiling as it doesn't include any code).
	4.2. Download the Boost Library package via "https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.59.0/boost_1_59_0.tar.bz2" and extract it to your "/usr/" folder (--> /usr/boost_1_59_0)(you may need to adjust the version number).
	4.3. Compile the required libraries (in /usr/boost_1_59_0: "./bootstrap.sh" and then "./b2 --with-program_options --with-filesystem --with-system --with-date_time --runtime-link=static --variant=release").
	4.4. Install the packages "libboost-system1.55-dev", "libboost-filesystem1.55-dev" and "libboost-program-options1.55-dev" (you may need to adjust the version numbers).
	4.5. Download the pugixml library from it's github page ("https://github.com/zeux/pugixml") and uncompress it.
	4.6. Move the uncompressed folder into the directory you wish (default location set in the makefile: /usr/pugixml-1.6/) (you may need to adjust the version numbers).
	4.7. Install the packages "make" and "g++" in order to compile using the makefile.
	4.8. Check the include paths in the makefile and adjust them if necessary.
	4.9. Compile with the makefile ("make -f makefile").
5. Download jQuery via this link: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js
6. Download the javascript file for the loading bar via the following link: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacoborus/nanobar/master/nanobar.min.js".
7. Download the jquery plugin "moment.js" via the following link: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.10.6/moment.min.js".
8. Download the following files from the unofficial fork of the jquery plugin "tablesorter": https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/ :
	- https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.tablesorter/2.22.5/js/jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js
	- https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.tablesorter/2.22.5/js/jquery.tablesorter.widgets.min.js
9. Move the "TS3_EnhancedClientList.js" and the other javascript files you just downloaded into your EnhancedClientList directory.
10. If you want to use the provided index.html (headline and all tables) skip to step 11, otherwise if you want to include the controls and the table into an existing HTML follow the 10.x steps.
	10.1. Include the control section by creating a div with the id "ts3-control".
	10.2. Include the "TS3_EnhancedClientList.js" and the "jquery-2.1.4.min.js" into the head section of you HTML.
	10.3. You can now decide which of the following tables you want to include by adding divs with the following ids: "ts3-clientTable", "ts3-banTable", "ts3-kickTable", "ts3-complaintTable" and "ts3-uploadTable".
11. Move the "index.html" into your created EnhancedClientList directory.
12. Move the "styles" folder into your EnhancedClientList directory.
13. Move the downloaded and unzipped or self-compiled "TS3_EnhancedClientList" into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory and make it executable ("chmod +x TS3_EnhancedClientList").
14. Move the "rebuildXML.php" and the "deleteXML.php" into the EnhancedClientList directory and change the file group to www-data (= owner of the web directories) ("chgrp www-data rebuildXML.php" and "chgrp www-data deleteXML.php").
15. Make the logdirectory readable and executable for group users ("chown g+rx /path/to/the/teamspeak3/log/directory").
16. Add the user www-data to the group under which your teampeak3 server is running ("usermod -aG yourteamspeak3group www-data").
17. (If necessary) Adjust the ECLPATH (path to the compiled file) in the "rebuildXML.php" and the "deleteXML.php" as well as the LOGPATH and the VIRTUALSERVER in the "rebuildXML.php".
18. Open the web interface by accessing the directory containing the index.html in your browser or open your self-created HTML on your server and enjoy scrolling through the tables.
19. (Optional) Add a file named "logignore" in your log directory and add the names of log files which you want to exclude from the parsing.
20. (Optional) If you would like to change the appearance of the web interface / your website you can do this by editing the "style.css" according to your wishes.
