This file contains the install instructions for the TS3_EnhancedClientList.

Linux:

1. Create the directory "EnhancedClientList" in the directory "/var/www".
2. Set up a .htaccess in order to secure the access to the directory (Skipping this step may result in serious security vulnerability of your webserver!).
3. Install the packages "libboost-system-dev", "libboost-filesystem-dev" and "libboost-program-options-dev".
4. Download a compiled file (-> skip to step 4) or compile the code using the makefile (for experienced users -> follow the 3.x steps).
	4.1. Downloads the makefile and the .cpp and .h files listed in the subdirectory "TS3_EnhancedClientList" (the todo.h isn't needed for compiling as it doesn't include any code).
	4.2. Download the Boost Library package via "http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.58.0/boost_1_58_0.tar.bz2/download" and extract it to your "/usr/" folder (--> /usr/boost_1_58_0).
	4.3. You will need to install the packages "make" and "g++" in order to compile using the makefile.
5. Download the jquery plugin "tablesorter" via this link: "http://tablesorter.com/__jquery.tablesorter.zip".
6. Move the "TS3_EnhancedClientList.js" and the "jquery.tablesorter.js" (which is part of the "__jquery.tablesorter.zip") into your EnhancedClientList-directory.
7. If you want to use the predesigned Webinterface.html then follow the step 7 a), otherwise if you want to include the controls and the table into an existing webpage then follow step 7 b).
	7 a) Move the "Webinterface.html" into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory.
	7 b) Include the controls and the table by creating two divs with the classes "ts3-control" and "ts3-clienttable" and include the "TS3_EnhancedClientList.js", the "jquery.tablesorter.js" into the head section of you webpage.
	7 c) (Optional) You can also include two divs with the classes "ts3-kicktable" and "ts3-upload-table" in your webpage. 
8. Move the "styles" folder into your "EnhancedClientList" directory (--> /var/www/EnhancedClientList/styles/) (if you don't use the predesigned html you have to include it into your html ("./style/style.css")).
9. Move the downloaded or self-compiled "TS3_EnhancedClientList" into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory and make it executable ("chmod +x TS3_EnhancedClientList").
10. Move the "rebuildXML.php" and the "deleteXML.php" into the "var/www/EnhancedClientList" directory and change the file owner to www-data (= owner of the web directories) ("chown www-data:www-data rebuildXML.php").
11. Make the logdirectory readable and executable for group users ("chown g+rx /path/to/the/teamspeak3/log/directory").
12. Add the user www-data to the group under which your teampeak3 server is running ("usermod -a -G yourteamspeak3group www-data").
13. (If necessary) Adjust the LOGPATH in the "rebuildXML.php".
14. Open the Webinterface ("your-server/EnhancedClientList/Webinterface.html") or your self-created html on your webserver.
15. (Optional) add a file named "logignore" in your logdirectory and add the names of logfiles which you want to exclude from the parsing (Important: Create the file on linux and don't copy it over from Windows!).
16. (Optional) If you would like to change the appearance of the Webinterface you can do this by editing the "style.css".
